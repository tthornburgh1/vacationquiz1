        <h1><span class="person1"></span>, you selected all 'A' answers. Your next trip should be to Kathmandu, Nepal!</h1>
        <img src="photos/kathmandu.jpeg" alt="Kathmandu">
        <p>For many, stepping off a plane into Kathmandu is a pupil-dilating experience, a riot of sights, sounds and smells that can quickly lead to sensory overload. Whether you’re barrelling through the traffic-jammed alleyways of the old town in a rickshaw, marvelling at the medieval temples or dodging trekking touts in the backpacker district of Thamel, Kathmandu can be an intoxicating, amazing and exhausting place.</p>

      <div class="answer" id="answer2">
        <h1><span class="person1"></span>, you selected all 'B' answers. Your next trip should be to Florence, Italy!</h1>

        <img src="photos/sydney.jpeg" alt="Sydney">

      <div class="answer" id="answer4">
        <h1><span class="person1"></span>, your next trip should be to Lucerne, Switzerland!</h1>
        <img src="photos/lucerne.jpeg" alt="Lucerne">
        <p>Recipe for a gorgeous Swiss city: take a cobalt lake ringed by mountains of myth, add a well-preserved medieval Altstadt (Old Town) and a reputation for making beautiful music, then sprinkle with covered bridges, sunny plazas, candy-coloured houses and waterfront promenades. Lucerne is stunning, and deservedly popular since the likes of Goethe, Queen Victoria and Wagner savoured its views in the 19th century. Legend has it that an angel with a light showed the first settlers where to build a chapel in Lucerne, and today it still has amazing grace.</p>
